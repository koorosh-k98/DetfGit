# DetfGit

Detf (maybe) last excercise.<br>

## How to do that?<br>

First of all install **Git**

Then **FORK** this repository (Shortly repo).

After that `clone` the repo in your computer.

e.g.

`$ git clone YOUR_REPO_URL`

The open project in android studio and check if it runs or not.

## What to add to this project?

Good question!

There's a `API_BASE_URL` at `Constant.java`. Go to the address and make POJO from that xml.

Mainly **Show the RSS result as a list in Main activity using recyclerView.**

### Things you need to pay attention to:

* Follow exactly the structure and pattern that already is in the project.

* For every activity you make extend the `BaseActivity` not `AppCompatActivity`.

* Add comment and explanation to your code. If i can't read your code then it's useless for team work,

* For every single task, I repeat **Every single task** you modify and add make separate branches.
> For example if you successfully added the network requests completely push it to `network-branch` not `master`. Then merge it with master.
> Make a new branch and go to it using `$ git checkout -b my-branch`

* I might make some changes and add it to my branches and give pull requests. You must review and merge if you want or reject with comment. So be aware.

* Be a good coder and don't make a mess.

**If you miss any of those points you need practice to be in a co-op project**

**Ask me anything you wanted. I'll answer.**
